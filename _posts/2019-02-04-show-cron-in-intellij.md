title: Display help text for CRON in IntelliJ 
---

Although [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) is originated in the unix world, it is a very common in programming environments. As a typical programmer cron jobs are not my daily business and I am not that good
in remembering those expressions and their meaning. Luckily there is a small IntelliJ plugin which shows the expression as a e tooltip.

So instead of the pure expression you get a human readable text as tooltip
