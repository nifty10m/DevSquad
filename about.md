Development is not only about creating technical solutions but also about helping other to create great stuff. For this reason at 10M we established a dev squad meeting. On a regular base all developers meet and discussion about technologies, tools and frameworks they are using.

The result of this meetings is now recorded on this page. The main audience for this is internal, but we think it might be helpful for other people too.
