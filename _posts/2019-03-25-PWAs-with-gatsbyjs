title: Turning GatsbyJS websites into PWAs
---

During the process of our company redesign we reimplemented our [website](https://10m.de) with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
Despite generating super fast websites Gatsby has a pretty neat plugin system which enables you to add common features such das sitemaps or RSS feeds
to your site by simply adding and configuring a plugin.

Since our Software Innovation team is focussing on the PWA (Progressive Web App) technology right now, we enhanced our website with some neat PWA features as well.
And with GatsbyJS they basically come for free!

# PWA essentials

* HTTPS
* Service Worker
* Web App Manifest
* Responsive Design
