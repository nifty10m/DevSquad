title: Display help text for CRON in IntelliJ 
---

Although [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) is originated in the unix world, it is a very common to describe althogh scheduled java task using a cron expression. As a typical programmer I am not that good
at remembering those expressions and their meaning. Luckyly there is a small IntelliJ plugin which shows some nice tooltip.

So instead of the pure expression you get a human readable text as tooltip

You can find the plugin here:
